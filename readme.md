<h3>deepSeaCoding.com version 2.0</h3>
    
<p>Hello everybody! This is the complete makeover of my personal web developer's (and more) site. It summarizes all my professional activities and services and serves also as an online portfolio.</p>
<p><em>Ok, but why a makeover?</em></p>
<p>When I coded and uploaded the first version I had just finished studying the base technologies, but I was in a hurry to get online some sort of professional web page. So, the first version was a single page application in pure HTML/CSS and a bit of custom Javascript. Just two pages, one for Greek and one for English. All media queries were set in CSS, no Bootstrap or other grid system. It was pretty OK (at least for my standards back then) but had some glitches on some older browsers.</p>
<p>As I learned more and more about coding and dived into frameworks I came to a better understanding of how my workflow should be organized and of how to set up a project. I started with Laravel and Blade templates, so Vue JS was the next logical step. And the best place to practice my new skills was no other than my own website! This is also the reason that despite having no back end, this project sits on a Laravel installation; it is an excercise for future projects, as I needed to see how Vue fits into blade templating and how to manage packages both for Laravel and Vue.</p>
<p>The core concept - a single page application, clean and elegant - remains, I kept all the original designs. However I used Bootstrap this time and there is a noticable difference in responsiveness and display.<p>
<p>I've also included some extra bells and whistles with animate.css, mostly because this site is also a show case!<p>
<p>For the same reason I used for localization a vue JS package, i18v, for maximum reactiveness! No database-driven translations, no multiple-page loading, everything is handled by Javascript on the client side! An overkill, perhaps, but I had much fun (and frustration) during the making process!</p>
<p>As always, feel free to speak your mind; comments and advices are always welcome!<p>
    
 <p>Best regards</p>
