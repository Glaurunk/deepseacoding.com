My personal web development site with emphasis to simplicity and clarity. 
No fancy frameworks here, just pure HTML/CSS plus some vanilla Javascript for simple animation effects. 
Instead of pages I used tabs to minimize complexity.
I made simple custom icons and used a CMYK chromatic pallette, indicative of the publishing domain I specialize into.
The animated gif adds some extra color and motion without - I hope - being too indescrete.

Cheers!
